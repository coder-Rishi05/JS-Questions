# JavaScript Practice Questions - README

This document contains a list of JavaScript concepts and problems that were practiced and solved in the provided code files.

## List of Questions and Topics Covered

### firstTenQues()
1. Print multiple values in a single `console.log`.
2. Perform an arithmetic operation (45 * 2 - 10).
3. Get the current year using JavaScript's `Date` object.
4. Print two string variables together using template literals.
5. Print two string variables together using string concatenation.
6. Re-declare a `var` variable and print its values.
7. Use `console.error` to log an error.
8. Calculate and print the square of a number.
9. Find and print the data type of a boolean variable.
10. Use an `if-else` statement to check age condition.
11. Understand what happens when dividing a number by zero in JavaScript.

### secondTenQues()
1. Demonstrate block-level scope with `let`.
2. Declare a constant and print its value.
3. Check and print the data type of `null`.
4. Check and print the data type of a stringified number.
5. Print the data type of a built-in object (`Boolean`).
6. Check the data type of different variables.
7. Print a declared but undefined variable.
8. Print an explicitly `undefined` variable.
9. Work with arrays and attempt to reassign a `const` array.
10. Understand constant reassignment error.

### thirdQues()
1. Print numbers from 0 to 50 using a `while` loop.
2. Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 9.
3. Print each character of a string using `for...of` loop.
4. Print all odd numbers from 0 to 20.
5. Print numbers from 5 to 0 using a `do-while` loop.
6. Find the factorial of 5.
7. Create and print a 3x3 grid pattern with numbers.
8. Reverse an array manually without using built-in methods.
9. Print multiples of 5 up to 100.
10. Loop through an object and print its keys.

### fourthQues()
1. Create an array of 5 favorite movies and print them using a `for` loop and `forEach`.
2. Filter an array element by index.
3. Add elements to the beginning of an array using `unshift`.
4. Remove elements from the end of an array using `pop`.
5. Slice an array (although `arr5` was used incorrectly outside the loop).
6. Check if an element is included in an array using `includes`.
7. Concatenate two arrays using `concat`.
8. Sort an array using default `sort()`.
9. Implement bubble sort manually.
10. Copy one array into another using spread operator and `forEach`.

### fifthQues()
1. Create a function to check if a number is even or odd.
2. Create a function to calculate the area of a circle.
3. Create a function to find the maximum of two numbers.

### Other
- Attempt to reverse a string (though incorrect approach used `val.reverse()` which only works on arrays).

---

## Notes
- Some code snippets contain minor errors like using `reverse()` directly on a string, or accessing undefined variables (`myArr`, `arr5`).
- Practice involved arrays, loops, functions, conditionals, objects, and basic data types.
- Good exposure to fundamental JavaScript operations and problem-solving techniques.
